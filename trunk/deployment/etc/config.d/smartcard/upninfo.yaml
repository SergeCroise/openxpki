# upninfo.yaml
# Resolve a login id to the associated upn
# Return value is a single scalar
# There are two supported query modes
# For logins of the format domain\user, we first check if there is a resolver
# at smartcard.upninfo.$domain and query if with the stripped $user value.
# Note: the domain part is uppercased!
# If no resolver is found or the login is in any other format, 
# smartcard.upninfo is used as a resolver with the full login as query
# A direct resolver can be in the list of automated resolvers, but mind the
# different query syntax in both modes!
